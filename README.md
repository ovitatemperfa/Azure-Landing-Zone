Hi!

Welcome to this ReadMe.

The purpose of this code is to enable automatic deployment of an Azure landing zone, complete with hub, SQL and AVD nets, all peered to each other. This demo was built using the following Azure documentation:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/

The purpose of this template is to easily deploy customer demos, without the need to manually provision the resources each time or maintain the resources longer than is required.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out via my user page. If you have any suggestions or additions, I'd also love to hear from anyone for collaboration.

Thanks!azure
